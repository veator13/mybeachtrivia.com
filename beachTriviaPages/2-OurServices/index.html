                    <h2>Classic Trivia</h2>
                    <h5>Classic Trivia stands as the cornerstone of our entertainment offerings, thriving since 2017. This time-tested format challenges participants' knowledge across diverse subjects in a structured competition that builds excitement throughout the evening for players of all knowledge levels.<br><br>The event consists of four distinct rounds with five questions each, carefully crafted to test various knowledge domains. What makes this experience special is the progressive scoring system, where questions become increasingly valuable as the night advances, allowing teams to mount comebacks and creating sustained tension that keeps everyone engaged until the final question.<br><br>Our program features two special segments that add unique twists: the halfway "Impossible Question" that challenges even the most knowledgeable participants, and the high-stakes final wager round where teams strategically risk points based on their confidence. This combination of steady competition with strategic elements keeps participants engaged throughout the entire event.<br><br>Beyond the intellectual challenge, Classic Trivia fosters community through friendly competition. Teams not only compete for tangible prizes but also earn coveted "bragging rights" until the next event, creating continuity that encourages regular participation and friendly rivalries between returning teams. Our carefully curated questions ensure everyone has moments to shine.</h5>

                    <h2>Music Bingo</h2>
                    <h5>Music Bingo reimagines the traditional bingo experience by replacing number calls with a dynamic soundtrack of popular music. This innovative format bridges generations and musical tastes while maintaining the accessible gameplay that makes bingo universally appealing to players of all ages and backgrounds.<br><br>Players receive bingo cards featuring a mix of song titles and artist names instead of numbers. As curated playlists unfold, participants listen attentively to identify either the song title or the performing artist on their cards. This dual-matching system makes the game more accessible while still requiring musical knowledge, creating moments of excitement when favorite songs play.<br><br>The communal listening experience transforms what could be a quiet, focused game into an energetic social event where participants can sing along, dance, and share musical memories while playing. The variety of playlists can be customized to suit different audiences, themes, or decades, making each Music Bingo night a unique experience with fresh musical selections.<br><br>The familiar bingo winning patterns (horizontal, vertical, diagonal lines, or full card) provide a comfortable structure for newcomers while the musical element adds fresh excitement. Prizes for successful "BINGO" calls provide immediate gratification and celebration moments throughout the event, making this format perfect for both casual gatherings and more formal events.</h5>

                    <h2>Beach Feud</h2>
                    <h5>Beach Feud adapts the beloved television game show format into an interactive group experience that rewards social intuition rather than factual knowledge. This engaging twist on trivia challenges players to think collectively rather than individually, creating a fun experience where anyone can participate and succeed.<br><br>Unlike traditional trivia where there's typically one correct answer, Beach Feud presents survey questions where multiple answers earn points, with higher points awarded to responses that match the most popular survey answers. This scoring system rewards players who can anticipate common thinking, creating a different kind of intellectual challenge where strategy matters as much as knowledge.<br><br>The format creates engaging moments as answers are unveiled in descending order of popularity, building anticipation as teams discover how well they predicted the collective mindset. The game generates lively discussion as teams must collaborate to guess what "most people" would say rather than recalling facts, making it perfect for diverse groups of varying knowledge levels.<br><br>What makes Beach Feud such a hit is how it levels the playing field - trivia buffs don't always have the advantage here! It's all about tapping into what others are thinking, not just what you know. With its familiar game show vibe, it's perfect for both casual get-togethers and team-building events. Everyone gets to join in, regardless of how much random knowledge they've got.</h5>
